        Hello! I'm Andrea García, a 23 year old Marketing graduate from Tec de Monterrey. I currently work at Instituto Nuevo Amanecer as Coordinator of Community Programs and Communication. 
      </p>

<p>I've been part of very interesting market research investigation projects with Herdez & Nestlé, GAIN Pilates & Cardio, Sigma and Capuleto Ristorante to help them target their audience and either improve their services, implement new communication strategies or enhance their digital plataforms. I'm highly interested in customer centered strategies and new technological appliances that can make them more useful and efficient for both the company and their customers. I love traveling and recently returned from Hong Kong and Thailand where I found the most breath taking views, mind opening experiences and lots of amazing people.</p>

<p>I'v been enrolled in the Boot Camp from ITESM for four months now and have learned about HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript, JQuery, FireBase and API's. </p>
<h3>Hope you enjoy my first Web Portfolio.</h3>
